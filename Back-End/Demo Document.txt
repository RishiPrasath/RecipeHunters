	"Grate the parmigiano regiano freshly into the ricotta. You can use as much as you’d like for this tomato ricotta pasta!",

	"Put the sauce back on the stove, add the ricotta mixture, and then mix until you have a beautiful pink tomato ricotta pasta sauce.",
	"Collect an extra cup of pasta water then strain your pasta before adding it to the pasta sauce and if it is too thick, add some of the pasta water to help thin it out. If not, leave it as it is.",
	"Toss the tomato ricotta pasta to mix the beautiful flavors together. Add some more freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese to the top; I did of course!",
	"E ora si mangia, Vincenzo’s Plate….Enjoy!"
