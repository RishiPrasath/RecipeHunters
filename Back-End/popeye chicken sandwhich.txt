  "briefdescription": "The Popeyes crispy chicken sandwich is the best. In my humble opinion, absolutely nothing comes close in the fast food world. Yet, even if you don't agree with me on this, there's one thing we can hopefully agree on: we can make it better at home. Yes, I said WE -- that means YOU. So today, we've made a homemade crispy chicken sandwich with a few simple twists that bring it to a completely new level. Popeyes chicken has a unique crumbly and crispy texture around the edges, and I've worked to figure out exactly how to replicate this. And I love it so much that I'll likely be using this method from this point forward in the kitchen whenever making a chicken sandwich.",

    "Slowly sprinkle in bread flour while whisking constantly until thick and clumped, and your tangzhong is complete.",
    "To a mixing bowl, add the ¾ cup of warm whole milk along with sugar and yeast, whisking to disperse. Let sit for 5 minutes.",
    "Add in bread flour and a sprinkle of salt.",
    "Using a dough hook attachment, mix on slow speed while adding the egg and the yolk.",
    "After a few minutes of mixing, add your tangzhong and allow to evenly disperse.",
    "Now add in your cold butter in small cubes, one at a time, and let it knead for about 10 minutes.",
    "Remove dough and form into a ball before placing in a greased bowl and covering with a damp towel to rest for 1 ½ hours.",
    "Flour a large cutting board and place the dough on top.",
    "Shape the dough into a long rectangle and cut into 8 even pieces.",
    "With each piece, pull all the corners to a center point and place the center point facing down on a cutting board.",
    "Roll the ball along the board to create a tight ball of dough.",
    "Let rise for 15 more minutes.",
