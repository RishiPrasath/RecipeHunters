Only some minor changes in that I used frozen cauliflower (it was on special!) and did all of the mixing in the food processor and added 3 tablespoons of full fat cream cheese and 6 oz of half and half to bring it together. Saut\u00e9ed the garlic in olive oil with the skins on (cut the ends so the garlic could escape easily) and used the oil as well as the garlic in the mix. Came out great. Didn\u2019t even need salt and pepper, lol!",
