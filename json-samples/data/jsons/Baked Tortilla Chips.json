Arrange wedges in a single layer on rimmed baking sheets.\nCombine lime juice and oil in a spray bottle or mister; shake until well mixed. Spray the tops of the tortilla wedges until slightly moist.\nCombine cumin, chili powder, and salt in a small bowl; sprinkle mixture over the chips.\nBake in the preheated oven for 7 minutes.\nRemove from the oven. Flip chips, then mist and season again.\nReturn to the oven, rotating the pans and switching racks. Bake, checking often to ensure they don&#39;t burn, until chips are lightly browned and crisp, 5 to 8 more minutes.\nRemove from the oven and cool slightly before serving. Chips will crisp up more as they cool.\n",
