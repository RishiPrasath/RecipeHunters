Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt to the mixture; stir to combine.",

The only differences I make in my recipe are that I dice my chicken, I do not add the extra water, I use coconut milk instead of yogurt, and I add diced green chiles. I also use about half the cayenne pepper called for because I cook for little ones. Tonight I didn't have tumeric and subbed that with smoked paprika and it still came out super delicious!!",
