That would be 325\u00b0 and about 24 minutes (but the time is pretty relative as I rely on visual and my meat thermometer). Pause to flip for balanced crispness on all sides (I usually spray all sides with olive oil before I start with the air fryer). You also may want to pause occasionally to check degree of \u201cdoneness\u201d and/or measure temperature of cooked meat (165\u00b0 in the thickest part of the breast meat for chicken). There is very little that I use my oven to cook and convert literally Everything to air fryer.",
